Just reference your solution in the PR.

> **Note**

> You need n-trees in this problem (trees that have an arbitraty number of children).

## 2. Duplicates

Create a function that verifies whether there are duplicate elements in a binary tree.

## 3. Level Max

Create a function that finds max element on each tree level of a binary tree.

The function should return a slice, which contains max elements on each level. Slice
indices should be treated as corresponding levels (level 0 corresponds to the tree root).

### Examples

```
Example 1:
     5
   /   \
  2     7
 / \      \
1   3       9
           /
          8
Returns [5 7 9 8]

Example 2:
     5
   /   \
  2     7
 / \
1   3
Returns [5 7 3]
```
